    "# Q2 - Supervised Learning\n",
    "# Definition: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with the corresponding correct output.\n",
    "# Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks for classification and regression.\n",
    "# Q3 - Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "# Definition: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given data without explicit instructions on what to do with it. The system tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the data.\n",
